There are two types of lists: unordered and ordered --- which are lists with bullet points, and lists with numbers.
* unordered
	* Indent each asterisk one space more than the preceding item
	* to make a list with more depth.
	* Seems like a `tab` will do better (have no errors in different environments)
* ordered
  1. unordered
  2. ordered
